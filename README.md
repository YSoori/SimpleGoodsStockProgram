# SimpleGoodsStockProgram

<h1>I made a simple GoodsStock program with JAVA.</h1>
<br>
<p>I made two classes.
<br>In one class, information on the name and quantity of goods, an increase in quantity through warehousing, and a decrease in quantity through shipment were implemented.
<br>
<br>Another class implements a program execution port environment as a main class, and the program can be executed through repeated statements.</p>
